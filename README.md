Built by Shayne Ndlovu, Plug is a portfolio project for Holberton School. It aims to make it easier for musicians to find each other and collaborate. It is a social media for musicians that removes the popularity contest aspect of social media. The focus was building a user friendly platform that focuses on connecting and collaboration and not directly growing one's audience.

Being a musician myself i often find myself unable to connect with some musicians if their follow count is higher. Sometimes said musicians could be willing to collaborate but due to how their social media accounts are set up they might not even see messages from accounts they are not following. 
Should they change their account settings they would start receiving messaged from all kinds of accounts. On both sides musicians are stuck having to find creative and often tedious solutions to this problem.

Plug aims to solve this problem. A platform strictly for musicians where users can create profile, add a profile image, add a bio, their location, specify their primary genre, post images and videos and send messages to other users. Other user can only like and add posts to their favorites. With no way to follow other users on the platform, this allows users to focus on finding musicians to collaborate with without worrying about account sizes. This was platform was built by a musician for musicians.

#this is the testing version with local database and storage and is run on my local server for testing. The deployed project with cloud storage and database is availabale on the link below.
