Plug

What is Plug?
Plug is a a platform meant to connect musicians. Social media platforms gave become popularity contests making it hard for musicians to connect if they are not on the same level in terms of followers. Plug will make finding musicians to colloborate with easy.

How Does It Work?
Plug will not a follow or following feature. Once a user logs in they will see a list of musicians on the platform. They will be albe to read their bios and navigato to their profiles and send a message shoould they be interested in collaborating.
There is also a feed page when you can see what other musicians have posted on the platform, like and save your favourite posts. Users will be able to navigate to a musicians profile from the feed page and sed them a message.
Where other platforms have created unnecssary steps to connect with other musicians Plug has made it simple and straightt forward with no hurdles. The reason for this is simple, if you are not looking to find and cpotentially colllaborate with new musicians, you have no business being on the platform so there is no need to be unreachable on such a platform.
