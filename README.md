# Plug

**Built by Shayne Ndlovu**

Plug is a portfolio project developed for Holberton School, designed as a social media platform exclusively for musicians. Its mission is to facilitate genuine connections and collaborations among musicians, eliminating the "popularity contest" aspect often seen on mainstream social media. Instead of focusing on follower counts, Plug emphasizes collaboration and interaction, making it easier for musicians to find each other without any barriers.

## Why Plug?

As a musician, I’ve often struggled to connect with others in the music industry. If a musician has a large follower count, it can be challenging to reach out, as many may not even see messages from users they don’t follow. Adjusting social media settings isn’t always a solution, as it can lead to an influx of irrelevant messages. This discourages collaboration and can isolate musicians by follower count. Plug aims to solve this issue by removing the focus on audience growth and enabling musicians to connect on an equal playing field.

## Features

- **User Profiles**: Each user can create a profile, including:
  - Profile image
  - Bio
  - Location
  - Primary genre
- **Media Sharing**: Users can post images and videos to showcase their work.
- **Messaging**: Direct messaging allows musicians to communicate and plan collaborations.
- **Engagement Without Following**: Users can like and favorite posts but **cannot follow other users**. This approach removes popularity metrics and promotes genuine connection.
  
Plug was built by a musician, for musicians.

## Technologies

This project was built using:

- **Django**: For backend and web framework.
- **PostgreSQL**: For database management.
- **HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap**: For the frontend, creating a responsive and user-friendly design.
